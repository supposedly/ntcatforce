Written by user Para, with the minimal amount of changes to give it a ~proper (ugly but usable) webpage interface

Use this the ntcatforce software from [this post](https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=163761#p163761). You have to paste the output string into LifeAPI.h (after the line that ends `const static bool table[512] = {`). You should also probably update the hardcoded RLE rulestrings in CatForce.cpp.
